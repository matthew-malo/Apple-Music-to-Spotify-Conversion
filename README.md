# Apple-Music-to-Spotify-Conversion
Conversion of Apple Music Library to Spotify using Python and Spotipy API

The purpose of this project was to convert my Apple Music Library to Spotify, as I wanted to change music streaming services. 
However, as my library had well over 1000 songs, I figured a fun thing to do would be to automate the transfer while experimenting 
with one of the open source APIs that Spotify lists on their website. This led to a deep dive into the interaction between 
Spotify's API, and the open source community that they promote, and resulted in a neat side project that I used for myself
and offered to friends if they were interested in switching music services as well. 


## Getting Started

The project required a bit of research into both the Spotify API and the Spotipy API that I used in conjunction.
The Spotipy API is very useful, however when I utilized it, it was not very well documented, and some of the functions required 
additional studying to fully understand how to optimally implement them in my code.

Spotify also provides a few useful Javascript files to get the localhost server up and running, which was essential as I had never 
written in Javascript before. The files are very well documented, and provide insight into how to access user data and modify playlists.
